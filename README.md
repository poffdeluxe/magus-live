# Magus Live

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Magus Live includes two basic examples of graph agents:
1. Essay Writer - A simple agent that writes an essay, given a topic, and does several revisions based on feedback
2. STORM - A basic (and a lil buggy) implementation of [STORM](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm) as a graph agent

## Next steps
* Fix Tavily tool call so the chain does it automatically
* Make live tail more efficient
